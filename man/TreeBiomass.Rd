\usage{
TreeBiomass(
  data,
  site,
  plot,
  species,
  dbh,
  ht,
  sp_codes = "4letter",
  units = "metric"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or tibble. Each row must be an observation of an individual tree.}

\item{site}{Must be a variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Decscribes the broader location or forest where the data were collected. The class of this variable will be coerced to character.}

\item{plot}{Must be a variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Identifies the plot in which the individual tree was measured. The class of this variable will be coerced to character.}

\item{species}{Must be a variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Specifies the species of the individual tree. Must follow four-letter species code or FIA naming conventions (see README file for more detail). The class of this variable will be coerced to character.}

\item{dbh}{Must be a numeric variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Provides the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the individual tree in either centimeters or inches.}

\item{ht}{Must be a numeric variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Provides the height of the individual tree in either meters or feet.}

\item{sp_codes}{Not a variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Specifies whether the species variable follows the four-letter code or FIA naming convention (see README file for more detail). Must be set to either "4letter" or "fia". The default is set to "4letter".}

\item{units}{Not a variable (column) in the provided dataframe or tibble. Specifies whether the dbh and ht variables were measured using metric (centimeters and meters) or imperial (inches and feet) units. Must be set to either "metric" or "imperial". The default is set to "metric".}
}
\value{
The original dataframe, with four new columns:
\itemize{
\item stem_bio_kg: biomass of stem (or bole) in kilograms
\item bark_bio_kg: biomass of bark in kilograms
\item branch_bio_kg: biomass of branches in kilograms
\item total_bio_kg: biomass of tree (stem + bark + branches) in kilograms
}
}
\description{
Uses Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Regional Biomass Equations to estimate above-ground stem, bark, and branch tree biomass. The package uses the California equation set and should not be used for data from other regions.
